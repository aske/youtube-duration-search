# youtube-duration-search
Example on using Google APIs with gogol library

Made to find a certain video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BowdMZcuoCc if you are interested for some strange eerie reason).

Run like this:
```
{binary} {max number results} {minumum duration} {maximum duration} {search before date} {search string}

cabal run -- 300 PT0H0M0S PT0H0M10S 2015-12 spiderman
```

Everything needs to be cleaned up.

Potentially may turn into a sane tutorial.
